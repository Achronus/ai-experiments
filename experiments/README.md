# Experiments

Welcome to the `experiments` directory! Here you'll find the folders for different experiments and their common modular components.

Here's a breakdown of each folder and file in this directory:

- `lcm/` - a folder for the Large Concept Model (LCM).
- `activation.py` - contains components for activation functions, such as the `ActivationEnum` and `ActivationTypeLiteral`.
- `weight.py` - functions for customizable weight initialization, specifically for `Linear` layers.
