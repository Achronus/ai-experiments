# Liquid Neural Networks

Welcome to the `lnn` directory! Here you'll find the files for Liquid Neural Networks, also known as Liquid-Time Constant (LTC) networks combined with Neural Circuit Policies (NCPs).

Here's a breakdown of each file in this directory:

- `cell.py` - logic for the `NCPLiquidCell` that uses sparse connections with LTCs.
- `ncp.py` - logic for the `LiquidNCPNetwork` that combines LTCs with NCPs.
- `wiring.py` - logic for the sparse connection `Wiring` for NCPs.
